# 25P
# Write a function that takes in a list of objects and converts each object in the list into a int.
# For objects that can't be directly converted to int should have their length counted
# The function will return a list with all int values ordered from largest to smallest.
# example [1, True, '123', False, 6, ()] will be transformed into [123, 6, 1, 1, 0, 0]
# 25P - (use recursion)
# After reading the above articles try creating a function to calculate the series (1^2)+(2^2)+(3^2)...(n^2)
# The function will receive an int that indicate the number of iterations, or how many times we have (x^2)+
# when resolving try using this logic: 1^2+2^2 is 1^2+(1^2+1^2)^2
# 25P
# Write a function that will calculate factorial of numbers squared.
# For n = 3 the function should calculate (1^2)(2^2)(3^2)
