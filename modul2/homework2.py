# 1) Prove that "and" operation takes precedence over "or" operation by setting
# parentheses in the following expression (False or False and True or True)

# 40P
# 2) Get from input two different times in the format dd:hh:mm:ss and print the difference between them in the
# received format dd:hh:mm:ss
# dd is number of days
# hh is number of hours (00-23)
# mm is number od minutes (00-59)
# ss is number of seconds (00-59)
